Game functionality:

MVP:
- As a user I want to be able to login and play SoMeRoc matches, my scores and statistics are saved
- As a user I want to find other players to match with in a Lobby
    (to be determined later, auto match making, invite links etc.)
- As an admin I want to have a specific login flow and get an admin tab/view
    - Remove users
    - Change general rule
- Game parameters (as MVP allow users to set a timer)
- Rule explanation tab

Nice to have:
- Chat function
- Make set selection process more interesting
- Spectators
- Global distribution?
